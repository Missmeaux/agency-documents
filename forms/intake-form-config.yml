                  Think about any special items you would like to give to people. This would include things like your clothes, jewelry, books, pictures, vehicles, musical instruments, or art. People often give special things to individual people, and then provide in their will that the remainder of their stuff (in legalese, their personalty) should be picked over by friends, and that anything remaining shall be sold or should be given to Housing Works or Good Will.
                example: |
                  The photo albums to my brother, should he survive me, and should he not survive me, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. All items remaining after specific distributions are to be divided equally among my surviving relatives as they shall so decide, and if they cannot decide, as my executor shall decide for them. Anything remaining shall be donated to Housing Works.
